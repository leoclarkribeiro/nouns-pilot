EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - DAY

Sun is shining, puffy white clouds in the sky. Scene is idyllic

FAN  
(in that choppy voice that happens when you speak into a fan)

Go loooooooong

GOAT  
(Straining to poop)

WINE GLASS  
(running back and forth to left and right, wine sloshing around)

KETCHUP  
Come on Goat, you got this one, you can do it

GOAT  
(straining even harder)

must...concentrate...

FAN  
(yelling to wine glass)
to the left....a little more, a little more...

GOAT  
(now bright red, finally poops into fan)

FAN  
Incoming!

Ker-ching! The fan's blades launch the turd and it goes screaming through the air
Wine Glass, now realizing he's out of position, starts running down field. Wine is sloshing everywhere.

All the Nouns watch with bated breath as the turd flies through the air. Wine Glass does a huge running slide, as though into home base, and...kerplunk, the Goat turd lands in the glass. All the Nouns cheer.

Ketchup bottle is spraying ketchup and it's raining down on everyone, Fan Noun's blades are covered in goat poop.

It's another beautiful day in Noun Town
[opening credits]


Exterior, Day, Stadium:

The nouns are filing into a large stadium
In the middle of the stadium is a podium with a jerry-rigged teleporter device. The stadium has a large LED screen overlooking the field
Elsewhere in town, the ______ noun is ringing the bell noun 
As the nouns file into the stadium, the garlic noun picks up the traffic cone noun, and puts the small end to his mouth like a megaphone:
"5 minutes to Noun O'Clock. Take your seats, take your seats everyone"
Helicopter: flies down into her seat
LIPS are applying lipstick
DOG: It's gonna be a dog. i know it. i just know it! tail wagging
KING Noun: I am ready for you, my queen!

The clock ticks down:
"Ten, Nine, Eight"

The jerry-rigged teleporter starts to power up, all the nouns look on in anticipation

"three, two, one"

all the nouns are looking at each other in anticipation...
but nothing happens

a hush falls over the crowd

the lips that were previously a smile, are now a frown

Suddently, on the large LED screen:
