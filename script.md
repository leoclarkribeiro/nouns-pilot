EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - DAY

Sun is shining, puffy white clouds in the sky. Scene is idyllic

FAN  
(in that choppy voice that happens when you speak into a fan)

Go loooooooong

GOAT  
(Straining to poop)
hmmmmmmmmm

WINE GLASS  
(running back and forth to left and right, wine sloshing around)

KETCHUP  
Come on Goat, you got this one, you can do it

GOAT  
(straining even harder)

must...concentrate...

FAN  
(yelling to wine glass)
to the left....a little more, a little more...

GOAT  
(now bright red, finally poops into fan)

FAN  
Incoming!

Ker-ching! The fan's blades launch the turd and it goes screaming through the air
Wine Glass, now realizing he's out of position, starts running down field. Wine is sloshing everywhere.

All the Nouns watch with bated breath as the turd flies through the air. Wine Glass does a huge running slide, as though into home base, and...kerplunk, the Goat turd lands in the glass. All the Nouns cheer.

Ketchup bottle is spraying ketchup and it's raining down on everyone, Fan Noun's blades are covered in goat poop.

GARLIC  
(smiling)
It's another beautiful day in Noun Town
